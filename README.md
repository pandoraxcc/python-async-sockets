## My playground for sockets library and python

<<<<<<< HEAD
The goal is to learn sockets by building some primitive code blocks using Python. For each commit I will try to added more robust server side / client side handling using asyncio library. That will help to handle multiple clients on the backend using one process/stream.

The code was shadowed from the author on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlWXhlUMyooawilqK4lPXRvxtbYiw34S8
